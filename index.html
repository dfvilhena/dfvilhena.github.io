         Let me describe to you by way of introduction the observation that induced me to choose "The threats to computing science" as my topic for this keynote address. The observation is simply that, when browsing through a computing science journal or conference proceedings, one usually sees at a first glance the geographical origin of the work described.

Now, in any area we have always had national differences, but their obviousness in computing becomes surprising as soon as we remember all the homogenizing forces at work during the first few decades in which the topic emerged, and allow me to mention a few of them, just to underline the strength of this argument.

Firstly, right from the start, English has been the Lingua Franca of computing: as early as 1956, when as a young Dutchman I gave my first lecture abroad, I did so —though at a German computing conference— in English. And as soon as, at either side of the Atlantic Ocean, the ACM and the BCS started their journals, these journals became the leading ones in the field.

Secondly, at an early stage, the computing scientists of the world became a travelling lot: the year of the UNESCO Conference in Paris, 1959, is about the time when the jet airliner became more common.

Thirdly —and this process had already started in the 50's— the computing community began to use more and more the same few machines and the same few programming languages. Even behind the Iron Curtain they could think of nothing better than faithfully copying the IBM/360 and are now busily implementing Ada at the request of the Red Army.

And finally, to deprive you of the last visual clues, people are beginning to use the same laser printers and the same text editing software. Gone are the days when Niklaus Wirth unmistakably identified himself by his typewriter and you could recognize his writings even when they were held upside down.

In short, in the young discipline of computing science, the homogenizing forces have been stronger than in any other discipline I can think of. And yet, the geographical origin of most of its publications is patently obvious.
